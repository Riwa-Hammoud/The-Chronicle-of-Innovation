<p id="description">The Chronicle of Innovation is a 1984-themed newspaper that explores the intersection of technology AI and the contributions of women in tech. This project also reflects my personal interests featuring sections on basketball and swimming alongside articles on innovation. It offers a glimpse into who I am blending my passions for sports technology and history.</p>
